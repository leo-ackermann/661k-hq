#+title: 🧬 High quality bacterial genomes from the 661k collection

This repository contains all the receipes of my genomes taken from the 661k
bacterial collection. I chose to consider high quality genomes, by which I mean
that genomes have: (a) N50>5000, (b) \#contigs<2000, (c) compleness >= 90%, and
(d) contamination <= 5%. Those rules are taken from the 661k paper itself.

⚠️ *WARNING.* Receipes assume [[https://github.com/ag-computational-bio/bakrep-cli][BakRep-cli]] is installed (and in your $PATH).

*** 🗄️ Organisation

The file [[file:661k_HQ.tsv]] contains the metadata of HQ genomes for 661k
collection. It was obtained using the BakRep website interface.

The other folders contain at least the following elements: (a) receipe.sh that
is used to pull contigs, and (b) ./contigs that contains the (uncompressed)
contigs. They would also typically contain other computed-once-for-all stuff
(eg. pairwise distance matrices).
